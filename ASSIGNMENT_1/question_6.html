    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>
      Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties.
      composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that
      explores the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>
      The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical
      elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe
      for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into
      groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>
      Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's
      an example of a <i>chemical reaction</i>:
    </p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + 0<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>0</p>
    <p>
      This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<var
        >H<sub>2</sub></var
      >) and oxygen gas (<var>0<sub>2</sub></var
      >) to form water (<i>H<sub>2</sub>0</i>).
    </p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>
      stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical
      reactions, It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and
      charge are conserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sub>Subscripts</sub> Indicate the number of atoms of each element in a
      molecule, while <sup>supscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of
      atoms in an ion.
    </p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
      Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From
      the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our
      bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
